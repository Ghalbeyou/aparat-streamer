# Security Policy

To report a XSS/Bug, first of all that bug should be from the program itself, not from you/your pc.

forexample, maybe you did not configed the app correctly and bugs will happen, but if you try to fix your config.json file and other things,

the problem will fix. another thing is invalid key, most of you will use invalid/wrong key for streamming; please make sure your key is ok
and it can be used

## If you have valid video file, valid path, valid config, valid key, then this is a bug from the program!
Report it in issue tab
